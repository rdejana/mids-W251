# Tensor Flow 

TensorFlow Lite now supports converting weights to 16-bit floating point values during model conversion from TensorFlow to TensorFlow Lite's flat buffer format.  We'll be using https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/post_training_float16_quant for this demo.  We'll launch directly from Google Colab.
